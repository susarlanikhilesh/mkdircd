# mkdircd
This script allows you to create and change directory at that instance.

This script is just the combination of mkdir and cd but this is written because there is a small theory behind this command.

Say suppose, if you created a directory and you took a few seconds to change into it. That directory could not be available as there can be some process which might use it. 

So, this command helps to create and automatically move into that directory.
